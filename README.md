### Hi there 👋

I am 15 years old, currently studying at school and will be a **software developer** in the future.
My curiosity about software came from childhood and i'm looking forward to learning new programming languages.
I am mostly a **web-based** developer. **Back-end** is indispensable.

 # Support 🙏

If you want to support me financially what you want, especially **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** you can send a cryptocurrency to my wallet. 
Before you do that contact me and you can get my wallet address, you can have special gifts for the supporters of your projects.
